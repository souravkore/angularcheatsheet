            What is state management in Angular ?
        </div>
        <div class="card-body">
            <p>State management in Angular refers to the process of managing and sharing data across different
                components in your application. It ensures that your application's state remains consistent and
                up-to-date.</p>

            Common approaches to state management in Angular:
        </div>
        <div class="card-body">
            <ol>
                <li>Component-to-component communication:
                    <ul>
                        <li>&#64;Input() and &#64;Output() decorators: Used to pass data between parent and child
                            components.</li>
                        <li>Services: Shared services can be used to store and share data across multiple components.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>State management libraries:
                    <ul>
                        <li>NgRx: A popular state management library based on Redux, providing a predictable and
                            scalable approach.</li>
                        <li>Akita: Another powerful state management library with a focus on simplicity and performance.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>

            Key concepts in state management:
        </div>
        <div class="card-body">
            <ul>
                <li>State: The current data or information that defines the application's behavior.</li>
                <li>Actions: Events that trigger changes to the state.</li>
                <li>Reducer: A pure function that takes the current state and an action, and returns a new state.</li>
                <li>Store: A centralized location where the state is stored and updated.</li>
            </ul>
            <h6>Example using NgRx</h6>
            <pre><code>
                {{code}}
            </code></pre>

            Choosing the right approach:
        </div>
        <div class="card-body">
            <ul>
                <li>Small applications: Component-to-component communication might be sufficient.</li>
                <li>Larger applications with complex state management: A state management library like NgRx or Akita can
                    be beneficial.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>By effectively managing your application's state, you can create more predictable, maintainable, and
                scalable Angular applications.</p>
