            What is Dependency Injection (DI) in Angular ?
        </div>
        <div class="card-body">
            <p>Dependency Injection (DI) in Angular is a technique where components get the services they need without
                directly creating them. Instead, Angular provides these services to the components.</p>

            Why use DI?
        </div>
        <div class="card-body">
            <ul>
                <li>Reusability: Services can be reused across multiple components.</li>
                <li>Testability: It's easier to test components when they don't create their own dependencies.</li>
                <li>Maintainability: Code becomes more modular and easier to manage.</li>
            </ul>

            How it works:
        </div>
        <div class="card-body">
            <ol>
                <li>Define a service: Create a class with the necessary methods and properties.</li>
                <li>Register the service: Add the service to the providers array in the '&#64;NgModule' decorator.</li>
                <li>Inject the service: Use the constructor to inject the service into a component.</li>
            </ol>
            <h6>Example:</h6>
            <pre><code>
                {{code}}
            </code></pre>
            <p>In this example, the MyService is provided globally, meaning it can be injected into any component. The
                MyComponent injects the MyService into its constructor, allowing it to use the service's methods.</p>

            Key points about DI in Angular:
        </div>
        <div class="card-body">
            <ol>
                <li>Dependency tree: Angular creates a dependency tree for components and injects services accordingly.
                </li>
                <li>Scopes: Services can be provided at different scopes like root, component, or module.</li>
                <li>Providers: The providers array in '&#64;NgModule' specifies where to provide services.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>By understanding dependency injection, you can write more modular, testable, and maintainable Angular
                applications.</p>
